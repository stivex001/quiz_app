My Vite Project
This is a simple guide to help you create and install a new project using Vite. Vite is a build tool for modern web applications that provides fast and optimized development server and build setup.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (version 12 or above)
npm (version 6 or above)
Getting Started
To create a new project using Vite, follow these steps:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project.
Run the following command to create a new project using the Vite template:
arduino
Copy code
npm init vite@latest my-vite-project -- --template [template-name]
Replace [template-name] with the name of the template you want to use. You can choose from a variety of templates such as vanilla, react, vue, preact, and more.

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory by running:

Copy code
cd my-vite-project
Install the project dependencies by running:
Copy code
npm install
Finally, start the development server by running:
arduino
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server and your project will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Building for Production
To build your project for production, run the following command:


Copy code
npm run build
This will create a production-ready build of your project in the dist directory.

Conclusion
That's it! You now have a new project created and installed using Vite. Happy coding!
